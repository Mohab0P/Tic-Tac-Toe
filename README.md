## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. In this project, you can play against an AI opponent or against another player.

## Features
- Play against the computer AI 
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Real-time updates on game status, including wins, losses, and ties.

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also access the live demo [here](#).

## Algorithm
The AI opponent in this game utilizes the minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. It works by recursively evaluating the possible outcomes of each move and selecting the move that leads to the best result for the player.
